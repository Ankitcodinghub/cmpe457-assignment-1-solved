Project will be delivered based on three phases

Each group of four or five students needs to register on blackboard and submit one project proposal. The project proposal is a one pager in pdf (any other format will be rejected), which includes:

1. Title of the project

2. Student name (s) (minimum 4 to maximum 5 students per group are allowed)

3. Abstract: explain briefly what the problem is and why you are tackling this problem.

4. List at least 3-4 objectives for that project e.g. to study the effect of noisy channel on the performance of TCP, to measure the performance of EIGRP routing protocol with and without security, etc.

5. List the project deliverables (at least 3 deliverables) e.g. simulation model for an MAC layer to provide QoS, quantitative performance comparison between ‚Ä¶, and ‚Ä¶, etc.

‚Ä¢ Phase II : Interim project submission: TBD

Interim project submission is a draft of the project report.

‚Ä¢ Submit online a softcopy of the draft report in pdf (any other format will be rejected) showing the information under the ‚Äúinterim project report specifications‚Äù.

Interim project report specifications:

You are asked to write a report of at least 3 double-column pages that discusses/analyzes the project description and outcomes so far. The report should include:

‚àí Abstract : not more than 100 words

‚àí Introduction: includes some of the existing work in this subject

‚àí System model: describe your elementary application architecture and design

‚àí Elementary results and evaluation: If there are any elementary results, describe them here. Note:- you must use the project template posted on blackboard (will be provided separately). Please, remove all the text in the template and add your relevant text instead.

‚Ä¢ Group presentations: (time: TBD)

Submission components: (read the following instructions carefully)

‚Ä¢ Submit online a softcopy of the final report as a separate pdf file (any other format will be rejected)

‚Ä¢ Submit online a softcopy of the final project presentation as separate pdf file (any other format will be rejected).

‚Ä¢ If the project implementation source is not too large, you can submit all implementation components online as a ‚Äúseparate‚Äù .zip file, otherwise, please copy all implementation components on a flash drive and put it my mailbox.

Final project report specifications:

You are asked to write a report of at least 5 double-column pages that discusses/analyzes the project description and outcomes. The report should include:

‚àí Abstract : not more than 100 words

‚àí Introduction: includes some of the existing work in this subject

‚àí System model: describe your application architecture and design

‚àí Results and evaluation: list, draw, describe, and analyze all the results of this application.

‚àí Conclusion: describe the main conclusions drawn from this application

Note:- you must use the project template posted on blackboard. Please, remove all the text in the template and add your relevant text instead.

Project assessment Specification;

‚Ä¢ Your report should be formatted and documented properly.

‚Ä¢ You should include in the final report a section of conclusions and discussions to highlight your opinion regarding the technologies investigated and documented in your report. Also, to demonstrate your opinion about the facts investigated and the results obtained.

‚Ä¢ Material should be collected from at least 10 different sources. Use the proper IEEE referencing as shown in the project template, and avoid as much as possible using mostly URLs as references.

5 Clarity of the answers to questions

Suggested topics (You are highly encouraged to come up with your own ideas):

1. Performance evaluation of secure routing protocol(s) i.e. routing protocols with and without security (i.e. tackled using either simulation or implemented application).
